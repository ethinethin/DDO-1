# DDO-1

In the fictional 1960s, engineers developed the inexpensive and popular minicomputer
called the Dynamic Data Organizer model 1, or DDO-1. This was a 16-bit computer
that ran with a small instruction set (only 6 memory-requiring instructions),
a low amount of resources (two 16-bit registers, one 1-bit register, 65,535 16-bit
words of random access memory), and a few peripherals.

This project is an attempt to bring this computer back to reality by implementing
a basic, portable simulator.
