# loop_test
I wrote the ASM for a quick loop program, then manually assembled the file
by outputting it word by word via a C program. Not the best way to do this
but this will help me move forward with the computer. I will write an
assembler later to make sure I don't have to do this manually every time.

The binary file is loop_test.ddo1. The others are self-explanatory. The
binary file is little endian, with each 16-bit word output with the low order
byte first.
